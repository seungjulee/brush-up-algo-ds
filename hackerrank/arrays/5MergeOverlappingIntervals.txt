Merge Overlapping Intervals
Given a set of time intervals in any order, merge all overlapping intervals into one and output the result which should have only mutually exclusive intervals. 
 
e.g. for this input: {{1,3}, {2,4}, {5,7}, {6,8} }. The intervals {1,3} and {2,4} overlap with each other, so they should be merged and become {1, 4}. Similarly {5, 7} and {6, 8} should be merged and become {5, 8}.
 
Write a function which produces the set of merged intervals for the given set of intervals.
