2D array search
Find a number in a sorted 2D array.
 
You're given a 2d array (N x M) where all the numbers (integers) in the array are in increasing order from left to right and top to bottom. You're also given a target number, to be searched inside the array. What is the best way to search and determine if a target number is in the array?

Solution: take inspiration from http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/search-in-row-wise-and-column-wise-sorted-matrix/

(Notice that this can be a very deceptive problem in a good way. Solution seems difficult, but it's actually quite simple.)
