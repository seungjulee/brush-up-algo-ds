Given a number, find the next palindromic number
(This question is quite rampant. Not sure why)
 
Given a number, find the next smallest palindromic number, larger than this number.
e.g
Input: 23545
Output: 23632 (This is a palindromic number, and bigger than the input. There is no palindromic number less than this and bigger than the input) 
 
Input: 99
Output: 101
 
Input: 6789876
Output: 6790976 (Note that the input may or may not be a palindrome itself)
 
Input: 8998 (Note that input can have even number of digits)
Output: 9009
