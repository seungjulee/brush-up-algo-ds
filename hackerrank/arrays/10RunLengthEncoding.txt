Run Length Encoding ++
(Not technically RLE, but very similar in concept. RLE is actually a trivial problem; but this one here is slightly more complicated)
 
L10n (where 10 stands for the number of letters between the first 'L' and the last 'n' in the word “Localization”), is called a Numeronym.

Generate all such possible Numeronyms for any given string (character array). for eg. for "nailed" :
 
"n4d"
"na3d", "n3ed"
"n2led", "na2ed", "nai2d"
 
Go until there is a '2' in the permutations. There is no point of going below 2, because that won't compress the string.
