Merge trees Coding

QUESTION DESCRIPTION

Merge two BSTs in O(N1 + N2) time, where N1 and N2 are number of nodes in the

two trees respectively. The merged tree should contain all the elements of both trees

and also be a balanced BST. Finally, print the new tree level by level.

e.g.

Tree-1: 2->1,3

Tree-2: 7->6,8

Output:

6

2 7

1 3 8

The output above is a tree that's printed level by level.

(This is a very good question. It's not hard at all, but will need you to write several

functions: one to parse, one to sort, one to merge, one to reconstruct and one to

Óù¢

print. Each of these can be separate short interview questions)

(This doesn't have the code to print the tree. But that's quite easy. Just do BFS with a

Queue and insert a sentinel at the beginning of each level)
