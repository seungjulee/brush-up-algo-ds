Clone a special list
(Courtesy, GfG)

You are given a Double Link List with one pointer of each node pointing to the next node just like in a single link list. The second pointer however CAN point to any node in the list and not just the previous node. Now write a program in O(n) time to duplicate this list. That is, write a program which will create a copy of this list.

Let us call the second pointer as arbit pointer as it can point to any arbitrary node in the linked list.

Like most linked list problems, please do this with constant extra memory.
